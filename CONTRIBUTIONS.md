## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Team Members:**
  - Collaborate closely with your pair partner to complete the assigned task.
  - Divide the workload as equitably as possible and support each other.
  - Use the project Kanban board for easier coordination.

- **Reviewers:**
  - Review the assigned pair's work when ready (in person or over call).
  - Provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
  - Reviewers can start reviewing parts of the deliverables as they are completed, rather than waiting for the entire draft to be finished.

## Review Process

1. **Completion of Initial Drafts:**
   - Initial drafts of each task should be completed by **October 8th**.
   - If a task is not done by then, the reviewing pair will contribute to finish on time.
   - **Note:** These deadlines are guidelines; please communicate any delays or issues.

2. **Review Period:**
   - Reviewers should provide feedback by **October 10th**.
   - Ideally, reviews are conducted pair-to-pair, but if schedules don't line up, the reviewing pair can read and comment on the content asynchronously.
   - I encourage an ongoing feedback loop; feel free to provide feedback throughout the process.

3. **Final Revisions:**
   - Teams should address reviewer feedback as soon as possible and finalize deliverables by the due date, **October 11th**.

## Open Door Policy

- I encourage open communication and collaboration among all team members.
- If you have any questions, concerns, or need assistance, feel free to reach out to anyone on the team.
- The pairs are guidelines; anyone can help anyone else.

## Communication and Collaboration

- **Primary Communication Channels:**
  - **Discord:** For general communication, file sharing, and team calls as needed.
  - **Pair Meetings:** Schedule as needed to coordinate on tasks.

## General Guidelines

- **GitHub Usage:**
  - Don't stress too much about formalities.
  - Commit message style: `Task/Pair #: Implement login feature`

- **Support:**
  - Don't hesitate to reach out to the team if you encounter challenges. Anyone can help anyoneâ€”the pairs are just guidelines.
  - Share resources and knowledge to help each other succeed.
